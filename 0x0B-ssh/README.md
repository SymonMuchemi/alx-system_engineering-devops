## Server

A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or functionality to other computers or clients over a network. It can host various types of software, applications, or files that can be accessed remotely by users or other systems.

## Where servers usually live

Servers are typically housed in data centers, which are facilities equipped with necessary infrastructure such as power supply, cooling systems, and security measures to ensure continuous operation. They can also be hosted in cloud computing environments provided by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.

## SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer or server over an unsecured network. It provides encrypted communication between the client and the server, preventing unauthorized access or data interception.

## How to create an SSH RSA key pair

To create an SSH RSA key pair, you can use the ssh-keygen command-line tool. Simply run `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and follow the prompts. This will generate a private key (usually stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and a corresponding public key (usually stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

## How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

Once you have generated your SSH key pair, you can connect to a remote host by copying your public key to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Then, you can use the ssh command along with the `-i` option to specify your private key file. For example: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@hostname`.

## Advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the beginning of a shell script allows the system to locate the Bash interpreter dynamically. This is beneficial because it ensures the script will use the correct Bash interpreter regardless of its location on different systems. On the other hand, specifying `/bin/bash` directly may lead to compatibility issues if Bash is installed in a different directory or if the script is run on a system where Bash is not located at `/bin/bash`.
