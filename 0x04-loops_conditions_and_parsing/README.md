# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

In this repository, there are files I used to learn the following concepts:

    - how to create SSH keys
    - the advantage od using `#!/usr/bin/env` bash over `#!/bin/bash`
    - how to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
    - how to use `if`, `else` `elif` and `case` conditional statements
    - how to use the `cut` command
    - what files are and othe comparison operators, and how to use them
